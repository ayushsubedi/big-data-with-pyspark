# Modifying dataframes columns

```
# Add a new column called splits separated on whitespace
voter_df = voter_df.withColumn('splits', F.split(voter_df.VOTER_NAME, '\s+'))

# Create a new column called first_name based on the first item in splits
voter_df = voter_df.withColumn('first_name', voter_df.splits.getItem(0))

# Get the last entry of the splits list and create a column called last_name
voter_df = voter_df.withColumn('last_name', voter_df.splits.getItem(F.size('splits') - 1))

# Drop the splits column
voter_df = voter_df.drop('splits')

# Show the voter_df DataFrame
voter_df.show()
